This project is about using a framework such as Spack so that we can create a pipeline to deliver a High-Performance Computing Optimized Software pipeline that is independent of the underlying operating system.

We aim to deliver a Transparent, Operating System Agnostic, Immutable software delivery pipeline that is reproducible and automated.
